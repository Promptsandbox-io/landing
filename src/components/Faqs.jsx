    question: 'What exactly is Chatbutler?',
    answer:
      "Chatbutler is a convenient and intuitive platform that lets you develop and enhance AI chatbots for your website. It's packed with an assortment of pre-configured components, a seamless connection to OpenAI APIs, and a live chat test interface in your editor, empowering you to utilize LLMs (Large Language Models) without writing a single line of code.",
  },
  {
    question: 'Can you explain how Chatbutler operates?',
    answer:
      "You can build AI chatbots by simply dragging and dropping blocks onto a workspace, and then interconnecting them to construct a sensible sequence. Every block performs a distinct function and can share information with other blocks. During the sequence execution, users can interact with the AI application via a live chat interface, allowing them to test and optimize their chatbot workflows. When you're ready to integrate the chatbot into your site, hit the publish button, and an embeddable script tag will be provided.",

Unlike many platforms, Chatbutler doesn't exclusively depend on loaded documents and URLs for each chatbot to create a responsive tool that offers users pertinent results. While we do support these features, our visual editor allows you to personalize your interactions even further.",
